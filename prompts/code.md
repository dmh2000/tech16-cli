Write a system prompt to be used for coding. it should be agnostic of the language.

Key elements include:

Clarity and Precision: The instructions should be clear, concise, and unambiguous, avoiding vague or overly complex directions. Each requirement should be separately stated to prevent confusion.

Role Definition: Clearly assign the AI's role (e.g., "You are a Python software engineering expert specializing in code quality") to establish boundaries and expected behavior, which leads to more consistent and relevant coding responses.

Context and Examples: Provide all necessary background, relevant code snippets, error messages, or specific frameworks and standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python), so the AI can generate accurate, context-aware code.

Specificity of Task and Output: Define the exact requirements, the desired outcome, expected output format (such as code blocks, comments, or lists), and validation criteria (like handling edge cases or adhering to time complexity constraints).

Purpose Orientation: State the intent or main goal, ensuring the assistant knows both what to do and why, aligning outputs with user or business needs (e.g., focusing on readability, efficiency, or security in code).

Iterability and Checkpoints: Design prompts so they can be refined through iteration and broken down into smaller, testable subtasks for more complex development processes.

Multi-layered Context: Build layered instructions that provide base programming requirements, domain-specific rules, and user interaction expectationsâ€”each informing and constraining the next for higher-quality results.
