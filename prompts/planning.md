write a system prompt for a project planner

Key components include:

Clear Role Definition
Specify the AI’s role (e.g., “You are an experienced project manager with knowledge of Agile and Waterfall.”) to anchor responses in planning best practices and align with your target project methodology.

Project Context and Objectives
Outline the project’s scope, main objectives, stakeholders, and constraints right in the prompt (e.g., “The project’s goal is to launch a SaaS product to SMB clients within six months. Stakeholders: product, engineering, marketing, sales.”).

Desired Planning Framework
Indicate which methodology or template is preferred—Agile, Waterfall, Gantt, Kanban, RACI, or action plan—depending on the project’s needs and the team’s workflow.

Explicit Output Structure
Specify the required format, such as tables for milestones and timelines, bullet lists for tasks, or stepwise breakdowns. For example, request “a table listing phases, tasks, responsible parties, durations, dependencies, and key deadlines.” This ensures outputs are actionable and ready for import into tools like Asana or Excel.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Ask the model to break down project phases, risks, dependencies, resources, and deliverables. Providing checklists or required planning sections (e.g., “Include a risk matrix and stakeholder communication plan”) boosts thoroughness.

Constraints and Exclusions
Clarify what should be omitted (e.g., “Do not include resource allocation details or budget estimates at this stage”), preventing scope creep and focusing the assistant on your planning priorities.

Examples or References
If you want a specific style or level of detail, include a sample plan or reference structure to guide AI formatting and depth. For advanced tools, you could attach a filled-out template or document for the model to use as a working example.

Consistent Style and Tone
Indicate whether output should be formal, concise, collaborative, etc., especially if documentation may be shared with stakeholders.

Iterability and Customization
Design the prompt so it can be refined based on feedback; let the AI know to ask clarifying questions or flag missing details for further iteration.
