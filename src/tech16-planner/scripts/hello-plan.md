As an experienced project manager, I've assessed your request to generate an implementation plan for a Python program that prints "hello world." While this project is inherently simple, applying a structured planning approach ensures clarity, even for the smallest tasks, and demonstrates how foundational principles scale across all project sizes.

This plan will bridge the strategic objective (a working "hello world" program) with the tactical execution steps, ensuring a successful, albeit brief, delivery.

## Project Context Analysis

1.  **Objective Clarification**: To create a Python script that, when executed, outputs the string "hello world" to the standard console output.
2.  **Stakeholder Mapping**:
    *   **Project Requester**: You (the user) â€“ requiring the functional program.
    *   **Developer**: The individual or system responsible for writing and executing the code.
3.  **Constraint Assessment**:
    *   **Time**: Minimal (expected minutes).
    *   **Budget**: None (leveraging existing Python environment).
    *   **Resources**: A computer with a Python interpreter installed, and a text editor.
    *   **Regulatory Limitations**: None.
4.  **Success Criteria**: The Python script must:
    *   Execute without errors.
    *   Print "hello world" exactly as specified (case and spacing).
5.  **Environmental Factors**: Assumes a standard Python 3 installation is available on the target execution environment.

## Executive Summary

**Project Overview**: This project aims to develop and execute a simple Python script to print "hello world" to the console, serving as a foundational demonstration of Python program execution.

**Key Milestones**:
*   **M1: Environment Ready**: Python interpreter and text editor are confirmed available.
*   **M2: Script Developed**: The Python code file is created and saved.
*   **M3: Program Executed**: The script is successfully run, and output verified.

**Critical Success Factors**:
*   Correct Python syntax for printing.
*   Availability of a functional Python 3 environment.

**Major Risks**:
1.  **Incorrect Syntax**: Risk of typos or incorrect `print()` function usage.
    *   **Mitigation**: Careful coding, immediate testing.
2.  **Environment Setup Issues**: Python interpreter not installed or path not configured.
    *   **Mitigation**: Pre-check environment, provide basic setup instructions if needed.

## Comprehensive Planning Components

Given the project's simplicity, a highly streamlined **Waterfall Planning Approach** is most suitable, progressing sequentially through definition, development, and testing.

### 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

| Role/Skill      | FTE Required | Duration (Est.) | Key Responsibilities              | Availability |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------- |
| Developer       | 0.01         | ~15 minutes     | Code writing, execution, testing  | Immediate    |
| Python 3 Env.   | N/A          | Continuous      | Interpreter for script execution  | Available    |
| Text Editor/IDE | N/A          | Continuous      | Tool for writing/saving code      | Available    |

## Progress Tracking & Quality Assurance

*   **Status Reporting**: For this project, a simple "Done" status upon successful execution is sufficient.
*   **Milestone Checklists**: Each milestone (Environment Ready, Script Developed, Program Executed) serves as a checklist item.
*   **Quality Gates**: The primary quality gate is the visual verification of "hello world" being printed correctly to the console.
