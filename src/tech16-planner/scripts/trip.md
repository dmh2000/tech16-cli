I want to tour the United Kingdom, include England, Wales and Scotland.
Create a plan for this tour.
The tour should be 10 days in lenth.
It should visit at least one significant location per day
Travel in the tour will be primarily railroad with local trips using Uber
I included a list of UK places from Wikipedia. use it as you see fit but you are not restricted to that list
