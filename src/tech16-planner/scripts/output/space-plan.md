Executive Summary  
Project Overview  
A piloted expedition to visit signature geological and atmospheric features on each major planet in the Solar System using a fusion-powered starship cruising at 1% of light speed (0.01 c). The mission departs Earth orbit, sequentially encounters Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and concludes at the dwarf planet Pluto before returning.  

Key Milestones  
1. Mission Approval & Funding Secured – Q1 2030  
2. Starship Integration & Ground Testing Complete – Q4 2031  
3. Launch Window Opens & Departure from Earth Orbit – Q2 2032  
4. Last Planetary Fly-by (Pluto) – Q3 2032  
5. Earth Return & Mission Debrief – Q4 2032  

Critical Success Factors  
• Robust fusion propulsion system delivering and sustaining 0.01 c cruise speed with reliable deceleration/acceleration capability.  
• Life-support and radiation-shielding systems validated for continuous crew safety over ~1-year mission.  
• Precise navigational control for close fly-bys at each target (≤1,000 km altitude).  
• Real-time telemetry and autonomous fault management to handle high-speed cruise anomalies.  

Major Risks  
1. Propulsion system underperformance – Mitigate via ground prototype testing and in-flight performance margins.  
2. High-energy radiation exposure during planetary fly-bys – Employ multi-layer shielding and optimized trajectory planning.  
3. Orbital alignment slip delaying encounters – Use trajectory correction maneuvers and flexible encounter windows.

Next Steps  
1. Confirm budget envelope and submit mission charter for executive approval.  
2. Establish technical working groups and schedule subsystem trade‐off workshops.  
3. Initiate prototype propulsion tests and life-support system validations.  
4. Refine planetary trajectory profiles and secure launch window analysis.
