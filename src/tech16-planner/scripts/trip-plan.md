## Planning Philosophy and Approach

This tour plan adopts a **Hybrid Methodology**, primarily **Waterfall** for its sequential, pre-planned nature (given fixed dates and destinations), but integrates **Agile** principles for daily flexibility and responsiveness to on-the-ground conditions. The emphasis is on a clear, structured itinerary with built-in considerations for potential adjustments.

### Methodology Rationale:
*   **Waterfall elements**: The fixed 10-day duration and specific country requirements necessitate a predefined sequence of phases (regions/cities). Train bookings also benefit from upfront planning.
*   **Agile elements**: Within each city/day, there's room for adapting the order of visits or selecting optional activities based on real-time energy levels, weather, or local recommendations.

### Stakeholder-Centric Planning:
The primary stakeholder is the traveler. The plan is designed for clarity, ease of execution, and maximum enjoyment within the given constraints.
