I want to generate a plan for a trip to visit interesting sights in our solar system.

- This is science fiction, so you can create any technologies you need, but try to keep them at least marginally feasible. No teleportation.
- Include stops at interesting features at each of the major planets of the solar system.
- Assume the mode of travel has a speed of 1% of light speed
- If you need any additional information before creating the plan, let me know and I
  will modify this prompt.
