Executive Summary  
Project Overview:  
A 42-day crewed expedition touring all eight major planets at 1% light-speed, visiting signature sites on Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune before returning to Earth. The mission balances high-velocity cruise legs with one-day in-system exploration stops, leveraging near-term “laser-sail” propulsion and advanced autonomous navigation.

Key Milestones:  
1. Mission Go/No-Go Decision (Day –90)  
2. Launch & Earth-Departure Burn (Day 0)  
3. Mercury Fly-by & Surface Recon (Day 1)  
4. Venus Cloud-Layer Survey (Day 2)  
5. Mars Polar Icecap Landing (Day 3)  
6. Jovian Great Red Spot Orbital Study (Day 5)  
7. Saturn Rings & Titan Fly-through (Day 8)  
8. Uranus Magnetic Field Mapping (Day 14)  
9. Neptune Methane-Storm Observation (Day 20)  
10. Earth-Return Burn Initiated (Day 36)  
11. Earth Re-Entry & Recovery (Day 42)

Critical Success Factors:  
• Propulsion System Reliability – maintain 0.01 c cruise without major thrust failures  
• Life-Support & Crew Health – closed-loop atmosphere, radiation shielding, medical readiness  
• Navigation Accuracy – autonomous course corrections to ±100 km at each destination  
• In-System Science Ops – deploy probes, conduct orbital & surface measurements in 24 h windows  
• Communications & Data Links – laser comms with <2 s one-way latency handling

Major Risks:  
1. Propulsion-Drive Failure – Mitigation: redundant power cells, in-flight repair kits  
2. High-Energy Particle Storms – Mitigation: onboard radiation shelters, real-time solar monitoring  
3. Navigation System Drift – Mitigation: dual-string inertial guidance + optical star trackers  
4. Crew Medical Emergency – Mitigation: tele-medicine protocols, emergency return maneuver  
5. Data Loss / Comms Blackout – Mitigation: store-and-forward buffer, deep-space relay satellites
