As an experienced project manager, I've analyzed your request to generate an implementation plan for a Python program that prints "hello world." While this is a very simple task, applying a structured planning approach ensures even the smallest projects are delivered successfully and provides a scalable framework for more complex future endeavors.

Given the project's simplicity, a streamlined, sequential (Waterfall-like) approach is most appropriate, focusing on clear steps and immediate verification.
